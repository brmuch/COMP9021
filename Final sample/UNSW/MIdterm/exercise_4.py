    A pair of natural numbers (m, n) is a Betrothed pair if:

    For instance, (48, 75) is a Betrothed pair since
    - the proper divisors of 48 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24
    - the proper divisors of 75 are 1, 3, 5, 15 and 25

    The least number >= 0 that is the first member of a Betrothed pair is 48
    The Betrothed itself is (48, 75)
    >>> f(50)
    The least number >= 50 that is the first member of a Betrothed pair is 75
    The Betrothed itself is (75, 48)
    >>> f(100)
    The least number >= 100 that is the first member of a Betrothed pair is 140
    The Betrothed itself is (140, 195)
