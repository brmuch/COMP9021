Then write a program span.py that prompts the user for a seed for the random number generator, and for a strictly positive number, nb_of_elements, generatesalistofnb_of_elementsrandomintegersbetween0and99, printsoutthelist, computes the di?erence between the largest and smallest values in the list without using the builtins min() and max(), prints it out, and check that the result is correct using the builtins.
