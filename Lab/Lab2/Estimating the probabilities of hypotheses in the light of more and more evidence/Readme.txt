Write a program bayes.py that simulates the cast of an unknown die, chosen from a set of 5 dice with 4, 6, 8, 12, and 20 faces. To start with, every die has a probability of 0.2 to be the chosen die. At every cast, the probability of each die being the chosen die is updated using Bayes¡¯ rule (?nd out about it if you do not know it). The probabilities are displayed for at most 5 casts. If more than 5 casts have been requested, the ?nal probabilities obtained for the chosen number of casts are eventually displayed. Depending on the design of the solution and the way random numbers are generated, di?erent results will be obtained, so we do not use seed() as that would not help get outputs that we could reproduce. So the outputs that follow are for illustrative purposes only.
