A number is perfect if it is equal to the sum of its divisors, itself excluded. For instance, the divisors
of 28 distinct from 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14, and 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, hence 28 is perfect. Write
a program perfect.py that prompts the user for an integer N. If the input is incorrect then the
program outputs an error message and exits. Otherwise the program outputs all perfect numbers
at most equal to N. Implement a naive solution, of quadratic complexity, so that can deal with
small values of N only.
