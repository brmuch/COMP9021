We want to decode all multiplications of the form
      *  *  *
x        *  *
----------
   *  *  *  *
   *  *  *
----------
   *  *  *  *
such that the sum of all digits in all 4 columns is constant.

Insert your code into multiplication.py. There are actually two solutions, see expected output for details on what it should be. If you are stuck, but only when you are stuck, then use multiplication_scaffold.py.
